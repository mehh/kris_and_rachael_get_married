          Oh no - something has gone a bit squiffy with the form. We're sorry to
          have to ask, but please can you try again later? It might be worth
          double checking your connection.

          If it happens again please let us know directly and we'll get it fixed

          If you've yet to make travel plans, you might want to look into that
          as soon as you can. It's a holiday weekend in the US, and the roads in
          Boston might be pretty hectic. You also deserve to stay in a really
          nice place - <Link to="/locations">we've got some recommendations</Link>
          , and obviously just drop us a message if you'd like any help sorting
          your schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, if you'll be driving from Boston to Laguna Beach we'd recommend you
          disregard what Google Maps optimistically says and give yourself about
          three hours for the trip.
