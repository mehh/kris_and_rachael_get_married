# :tada: Our wedding website :couple_with_heart:

https://krisandrachael.com

Some of our best friends have been getting married this year, so it's safe to say we've seen some really nice wedding websites - so when it was _our_ turn to tie the knot I wanted to have a go at putting something together. In lieue of having paper invitations and some of the other things we'll be putting together, the decision was that we figured having a website would be the best way to quickly get information out there

For some reason we also happen to be really into serif fonts at the moment.

And pineapples.

More than happy to be on the recieving end of any tips regarding best practice or other optimisations :ok_hand:
